Done. make dmg will reuse this identity.

If Accessibility still looks granted but does not work, clear the stale
entry once:

  tccutil reset Accessibility com.voiceflow.desktop

Then replace /Applications/VoiceFlow.app from a freshly signed DMG and grant
access again. Later updates that use this same certificate should keep it.

To let GitHub Actions sign releases with this same identity:

  gh secret set MACOS_CERT_P12 < ${OUT_DIR}/VoiceFlow.p12.base64
  gh secret set MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD --body '${p12_password}'

That password is also written to ${OUT_DIR}/password.txt. Without those two
secrets, CI builds an unsigned DMG and permissions will reset on each GitHub
update.
